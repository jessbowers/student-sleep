### Things that can help you sleep

If you have difficulty sleeping, there are several things you can do. 

![Exercise](images/Exercise.jpg)

**Exercise.** Work out several hours before bedtime, ideally in the morning, to get good sleep. Block out a time that works for you to exercise every day. Not only will exercising help you sleep better, but it will make you a healthier person overall. Your college probably has a gym that you can use. Try to head over there before your classes begin in the morning. Get your friend or roommate to go with you. Do exercises that you enjoy!

**Avoid caffeine.** Most college students can be found with a coffee cup or energy drink in hand at any hour of the day. It might not shock you to learn that the thing you consume to keep you awake is in fact, keeping you awake. But if you want to prioritize sleep, you need to cut down your caffeine intake or cut it out all together. Even consuming caffeine 6 hours before bed can cause trouble sleeping. Instead of grabbing a coffee at the dining hall, try non-caffeinated tea. If you love the taste of coffee, you can aways drink decaf. If you really need caffeine, set a time of day that you will stop drinking any caffeinated beverages so that your system can be clear before its time to sleep.

**Keep electronics off before bed.** A study done by the Journal of Pediatric Research in 2019 found that the use of an electronic device before sleeping caused poorer quality of sleep. The blue light from screens tricks your body into producing cortisol and messes up your preparation for sleep. Though it can be so tempting to scroll on Instagram for hours before sleeping, try to not look at your phone for the hour or so before bed to help yourself relax. You could also charge your phone out of your reach so you won’t be tempted to go on it.

**See a therapist.** When you are stressed out your quality of sleep is poor. Your campus most likely has a counseling center. Seek help from a professional there to help you manage stress.

**Take Hemp CBD capsules or oil.** CBD can be helpful to relax you in preparation for sleep. Many people associate CBD with marijuana, but no, this is not a suggestion to do marijuana. CBD is lacking THC which provides the “high” associated with marijuana. It is currently not FDA approved, though many people see calming and medicinal benefits from taking it. You can find CBD at many stores or CBD-specific stores.

**Take medication.** There are several over the counter medications, chemical or natural, that you can use such as Aleve PM, Unisom SleepTabs, Valerian, and Melatonin. These will help you sleep, but are not something that you should be using every night, and most have side effects. You should talk to your doctor or consider other options before pursuing medication.
