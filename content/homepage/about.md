This website was created by Stella Bowers, a current college student. When she first entered college she found herself struggling to balance school, friends, and sleep. Her sleep was often sacrificed to spend more time with friends or studying. Resulting from this decision was grumpiness, trouble managing anxiety, and difficulty retaining learned information. She found that once she took the steps to prioritize her sleep she was happier, less stressed out, and was able to learn better.
