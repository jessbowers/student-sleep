If you try everything recommended on this website and you are still having difficulty sleeping, you may have a sleep disorder. The most common sleep disorders are Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and Narcolepsy. Insomnia is when someone does not get enough sleep each night. If you have difficulty falling/staying asleep and feel extremely tired the next day, you may suffer from Insomnia. Sleep Apnea is when someone’s body stops breathing briefly and then they wake up gasping for air. If you find yourself waking up gasping for air and laying in bed for hours but only sleeping half that time, you may experience Sleep Apnea. Narcolepsy is when someone’s body causes them to sleep at random points during the day. If you are experiencing this, you may have Narcolepsy. You can use medical help or make lifestyle changes to help with sleep disorders. The CDC Website has accumulated links that people who think they have sleep disorders may find helpful to use. (https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/resources.html) If you think you may have a sleep disorder you should seek medical help. Make an appointment with your doctor to discuss what you should do to take care of yourself.
