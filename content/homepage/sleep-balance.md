![Sleeping on a desk](images/sleep-desk.jpeg)

At college, you have so much to do and so little time to do it. You have to attend classes, do homework and study, hang out with friends, eat, and have a job. This barely gives you time to rest or sleep. Many college students find themselves sacrificing their sleep so they have time to do all of these other activities. It's okay if you have difficulty managing all of these responsibilities, you are not alone. 

Let’s say that last night you stayed up until 4am cramming for a test the next day. You wake up at 8am to make it to your 9am test. You got only 4 hours of sleep. You rush to your test and find that you remember almost nothing on the test, have difficulty focusing, and can barely stay awake. An alternative to this would be to study over the corse of a few days so you don't end up leaving it all for last minute. You could read over all your notes or flash cards once before bed the night before and get at least 8 hours of sleep. Then when you wake up, you will find that you are alert, focused, and fully prepared for your test. 

A strategy you can use would be to create a schedule. If you create a schedule it can help you to find time to do everything you’d like. Try to give yourself around 8 or 9 hours of sleep each night. You can try to get all homework done before you eat dinner to give yourself time to see friends and get to bed on time each evening. Sometimes you have to say no to things to prioritize your sleep. Remember that you will thank yourself later when you choose to get a full nights rest instead of going out.
