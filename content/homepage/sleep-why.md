Did you know that we spend 1/3 of our lives asleep? 

Sleep is defined by the Merriam-Webster Dictionary as “the natural, easily reversible periodic state of many living things that is marked by the absence of wakefulness and by the loss of consciousness of one's surroundings.” 
Sleep is essential to helping you feel in a good mood, have more energy, and be more alert. There are some serious consequences to not sleeping. Not only will you feel grumpy and less focused, but prolonged lack of sleep can lead to depression, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. These are reasons to prioritize sleep for sure. 

Though Psychologists know that sleep is as necessary as eating or drinking, they are still unsure as to the biological reason for sleep. Currently there are several theories as to why we sleep. One is called the Repair and Restoration theory. This is the idea that while we are asleep, our bodies are recovering from our physical and mental tasks throughout the day. Another theory is the Energy-Conservation theory, which is that animals have evolved to have a regular sleep and wake pattern to have them sleep when it is more difficult to hunt for food.

Psychologists have split up sleep into four stages. Stage 1 is a light sleep that only lasts for a few minutes and your body begins to relax. Stage 2 is longer but still light and your body continues to relax. You spend the most time in Stage 2. Stage 3 is the deepest stage and your body is the most relaxed. Rapid Eye Movement, or REM, sleep is the stage where you dream. Your eyes move back and forth rapidly. Though your body is still very relaxed your breathing and heart rate rise. Your body will rotate through these different stages throughout the course of the night. 
Another important factor to sleeping is your circadian rhythm. This is often referred to as your biological clock. It tells you when to be awake and when to be asleep. It syncs up with the rising and setting of the sun, but can occur even without these signals.
